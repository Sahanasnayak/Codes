# Codes
These are my codes on sensors and motors.
1)Sensors: worked on ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04), IR sensor, temperature sensor(LM35) and LDR. Designed circuit to implement these sensors in real time and these are programmed and controlled using Arduino UNO.

2)Motors: designed circuit using driver module(L298N) for different motors like DC motor, servo motor
and bow motor. Control of speed, direction and angle of rotation is programmed using Arduino.
